This is dnscache project for Baidu.

https://github.com/gmsh/dnscache branch:final

===============================================================

Baidu's large-scale cluster environments has a module, it needs
to specify the user's machine name list, and connect these mac-
hines to complete certain tasks. In this process, a large number
 of the domain name will be resolved, not only cause greater pr-
essure on the DNS server, but also prone to parsing fails.We 
design such a project called dnscache to slove this problem.

This project includes server and client.

===============================================================
Server Usage:

$cd server
$vi constant.h		% you can choose you favourite editor
			% modify the SERVIP and PORT and other
			% arguments.
$make 
$./mainserver

when you see such things below printed on the screen, it means
         ****************************************
         * dc_mm : dns cache memory management  *  
         *         modules has been initilized. *
         * dl_Kache init OK                     *
         * tcp server started                   *
         * udp server started                   *
         ****************************************
the server is started! Have fun in our project.

===============================================================
Client Usage:

$cd client
$vi constant.h		% you can choose your favourite editor
			% modify the SERVIP and PORT the same
			% with configure with server
$vi test_client.h	% you also can choose your favourite 
			% editor.modify THREAD_NUM(one imitat-
			% ion per thread ), DN_NUM_LIMIT(we 
			% generate random number between 0 and
			% DN_NUM_LIMIT)
$make 
$./test_client

waring: you must conneted to server after the server started.
